# Teddy

Teddy is not Pandas. Teddy is lightweight and snuggly.

Teddy is straightforward and understands you. Teddy loves you.

## Feature overview

Teddy loves you so much, it will work with vanilla Python types.

```python
from collections
record = namedtuple
data = list()
```

## Private Notes

### TODOs

* [ ] find another name for IndexedMapping?
* [ ] support indexing by another Teddy instance or an IndexedMapping.
* [x] we need a sequential type that exposes a dict interface but stores a list internally...
* [d] figure out a structure for POPO vs other possible impls
* [x] add tests
* [ ] figure out a name for different kinds of predicates
* [x] add support for implicit lambdas
* [x] support for a literal function that allows for accessing any constant in a dict that has special meaning for teddy.
