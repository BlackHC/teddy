# Teddy

Teddy is not Pandas. Teddy is lightweight and snuggly.

Teddy is straightforward and understands you. Teddy loves you.

## Feature overview

Teddy loves you so much, it will work with vanilla Python types.

```python
from collections
record = namedtuple
data = list()
```

## Private Notes

### TODOs

* [ ] we need a sequential type that exposes a dict interface but stores a list internally...
* [ ] figure out a structure for POPO vs other possible impls
* [ ] add tests
* [ ] figure out a name for different kinds of predicates
* [ ] add support for implicit lambdas
* [ ] support for a literal function that allows for accessing any constant in a dict that has special meaning for teddy.
